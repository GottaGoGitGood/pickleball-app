# Pickleball League Manager (PLM)

> 🚧 **Status:** Working on it! (v0.1.0)

## 👋 About the Project
I am building this app to make life easier for local pickleball groups.

Right now, most groups try to organize games and track scores in messy group chats. It’s hard to tell who is winning or what skill level everyone is at. This app fixes that by giving players one place to log their scores, check their stats, and see who is actually the best in the league.

## 🛠 What I'm Using to Build It
* **Frontend:** React.js (The part you see and click on)
* **Backend:** Node.js & Express (The brain of the app)
* **Database:** MySQL (Where all the scores and users are saved)
* **Security:** (Coming soon - secure logins for everyone)

## ✨ What It Will Do

### 🏆 Managing Leagues
* **Start a League:** Anyone can start a group, like "Wayne County Weeknight Doubles."
* **Join In:** Players can find local leagues and ask to join.
* **Leaderboards:** The app automatically ranks everyone based on wins and losses.

### 📊 Scores & Skills
* **No Cheating:** The winner enters the score, but the loser has to confirm it before it counts.
* **Skill Levels:** We use the real rating system so you know who you are playing against:
    * **2.5 - 3.0:** Beginner / Just for fun
    * **3.5 - 4.0:** Intermediate (Consistent dinking)
    * **4.5 - 5.0+:** Advanced / Tournament level
* **History:** Look back at your old games to see if you are improving.

### 🛡 Who Can Do What
* **Admins:** The person running the league. They can fix bad scores or ban troublemakers.
* **Players:** Can play games, log scores, and update their profile.

## 🚀 To-Do List
- [x] **Start:** Got the basic folders and files set up.
